## Developers' Guide

The app is implemented using React Router v6, with Material UI for layout and design.
Data are retrieved from the EBRAINS Knowledge Graph using the [KG Core API](https://docs.kg.ebrains.eu/).

### Setting up a development environment

The main code repository is https://gitlab.ebrains.eu/data-services/neural-activity-resource.
You should fork this into your own account.

  $ git clone https://gitlab.ebrains.eu/<your account>/neural-activity-resource

  $ cd neural-activity-resource/apps/nar-v3
  $ npm install

To run a development server, you will need to obtain an EBRAINS IAM authorization token,
paste it into src/main.jsx, then run:

  $ npm run dev

Before committing changes, make sure the test suite passes:

  $ npm run test

To see which code needs more tests:

  $ npm run coverage


### Deployment

The app is deployed to https://nar.apps.tc.humanbrainproject.eu using Kubernetes.
See the "deployment" folder and .gitlab-ci.yml for more details.
